# Popcorn Books

## Frontend App that implements the Google books Api for display and search of books

- Uses axios to call the google books api to get the first 5 volumes found
- handles api responses, loading and errors through a custom context hook 😁
- Allows you to save a reading list (using local storage)

Install dependencies with `npm i`

Run the project with `npm start`

##### PS: The loader is a custom animated GIF, I put quite some time and a lot of heart into it hope u think its cool 😊
